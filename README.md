AltSchool Application Form

This project includes two HTML pages linked together, providing a simple website structure for an AltSchool application. The pages are designed to be accessible and include global navigation for easy user interaction.
Pages

    About Me Page (about_me.html)

    This page contains details about the applicant, including personal information, reasons for joining AltSchool, and the applicant's plans and goals with AltSchool.

    Application Form Page (application_form.html)

    This page replicates the AltSchool application form available at https://portal.altschoolafrica.com/auth/create-account. It includes various fields such as first name, last name, gender, date of birth, email address, education level, country, state/city of residence, employment status, phone number, school selection, course of study, how the applicant heard about AltSchool, and an optional scholarship/discount code. The form includes required fields marked with red asterisks.

Both pages include a global navigation bar for seamless movement between the "About Me" and "Application Form" sections.
